	  The PROV Ontology (also PROV-O) encodes the PROV Data Model [[PROV-DM]] in the OWL2 Web Ontology Language (OWL2). The PROV ontology consists of a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent provenance information. The PROV ontology can also be specialized to create new classes and properties for modeling provenance information specific to different domain applications.

	  This specification defines the PROV Ontology as the normative representation of the PROV Data Model using the Web Ontology Language (OWL2). This document is part of a set of specifications being created to address the issue of provenance interchange in Web applications. This document is accompanied by (1) the PROV Data Model, (2) the PROV Access and Query, and (3) the Primer documents.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>  
      <p>
        PROV Ontology (also PROV-O) defines the normative modeling of the PROV Data Model [[PROV-DM]] using the W3C OWL2 Web Ontology Language. This document specification describes the set of classes, properties, and restrictions that constitute the PROV ontology, which have been introduced in the PROV Data Model [[PROV-DM]]. This ontology specification provides the foundation for implementation of provenance applications in different domains using the PROV ontology for representing, exchanging, and integrating provenance information. Together with the PROV Access and Query [[PROV-PAQ]] and PROV Data Model [[PROV-DM]], this document forms a framework for provenance information interchange and management in domain-specific Web-based applications.
      </p>
	  <p>
		The PROV ontology classes and properties are defined such that they can not only be used directly to represent provenance information, but also can be specialized for modeling application-specific provenance details in a variety of domains. Thus, the PROV ontology is expected to be both directly usable in applications as well as serve as a <i>reference model</i> for creation of domain-specific provenance ontology and thereby facilitate interoperable provenance modeling. This document uses an example <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111018/#a-file-scenario"> provenance scenario </a> introduced in the PROV Data Model [[PROV-DM]] to demonstrate the use PROV-O classes and properties to model provenance information. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Finally, this document describes the formal semantics of the PROV ontology using the OWL2 semantics, [[!OWL2-DIRECT-SEMANTICS]], [[!OWL2-RDF-BASED-SEMANTICS]], and a set of provenance-specific inference rules. This is expected to support provenance implementations to automatically check for consistency of provenance information represented using PROV ontology and explicitly assert implicit provenance knowledge. 
	  </p>
	  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and       "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].</p>

	<section>
      <h2>PROV-O at a glance</h2>
      <p> The PROV Data Model [[PROV-DM]] introduces a minimal set of concepts to represent provenance information in a variety of application domains. This document maps the PROV Data Model to PROV Ontology using the OWL2 ontology language, which facilitates a fixed interpretation and use of the PROV Data Model concepts based on the formal semantics of OWL2 [[!OWL2-DIRECT-SEMANTICS]] [[!OWL2-RDF-BASED-SEMANTICS]]. 
	  </p>
	  <p>The PROV Ontology can be used directly in a domain application, though many domain applications may require specialization of PROV-O Classes and Properties for representing domain-specific provenance information. We briefly introduce some of the OWL2 modeling terms that will be used to describe the PROV ontology. An OWL2 <i>instance</i> is an individual object in a domain of discourse, for example a person named Alice or a car, and a set of individuals sharing a set of common characteristics is called a <i>class</i>. Person and Car are examples of classes representing the set of individual persons and cars respectively. The OWL2 object properties are used to link individuals, classes, or create a property hierarchy. For example, the object property "hasOwner" can be used to link car with person. The OWL2 datatype properties are used to link individuals or classes to data values, including XML Schema datatypes [[!XMLSCHEMA-2]].   
	  </p>
	  <p>The PROV Data Model document [[PROV-DM]] introduces an example <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111018/#a-file-scenario"> provenance scenario </a> describing the creation of crime statistics file stored on a shared file system and edited by journalists Alice, Bob, Charles, David, and Edith. This scenario is used as a running example in this document to describe the PROV ontology classes and properties, the specialization mechanism, and the entailments supported by the PROV ontology.

      <h2>Cross reference for PROVO classes and properties</h2>
	    <p>The PROV Ontology does not include all the provenance terms that are required by different application to model provenance information. For example, the classes and properties to model provenance information in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111018/#a-file-scenario">provenance scenario</a>, such as "Journalist" or "FileEditing", are not part of the PROV ontology. This is a deliberate design choice for PROV ontology, since modeling provenance terms for a variety of domain applications in a single ontology is impractical. Hence, the PROV Ontology is conceived as an ontology that can be extended by various domain-specific applications to model the required set of provenance terms. The PROV Ontology classes and properties can be specialized using the following two RDFS properties:</p>
   		<ul>
            <li><i>rdfs:subClassOf</i>: The property rdfs:subClassOf is an instance of rdf:Property that is used to state that all the instances of one class are instances of another [[!RDF-SCHEMA]]</li>
            <li><i>rdfs:subPropertyOf</i>: "A rdfs:subPropertyOf axiom defines that the property is a subproperty of some other property" [[!RDF-SCHEMA]]</li>
         </ul>
         <p>A new provenance ontology can be created to model the classes and properties required by an application to represent its domain-specific provenance terms. The new provenance ontology, for the given application, is also expected to include all the PROV Ontology classes and properties, which will facilitate provenance exchange through a common set of terms.</p>
         <p>The following are a few example classes from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-prov-dm-20111018/#a-file-scenario">provenance scenario</a> that are created by specializing PROV Ontology classes:
		   <ul>
		     <li>The <a href="#agent">Agent</a> class can be specialized to define a class called Journalist, which has individuals such as alice, bob, and edith </li>
			 <li>Similarly, the <a href="#activity">Activity</a> class can be specialized to define classes called FileCreation, FileAppending, and FileEditing </li>
		   </ul>
	      The [[PROV-BestPractices]] document describes in detail the approach used to model provenance information in two domain-specific examples by specializing the PROV Ontology.</p>
