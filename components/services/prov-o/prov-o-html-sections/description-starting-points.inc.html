	  	<h3>Starting Point Terms</h3>
       <p>The Starting Point category is a small set of classes and properties that can be used to create simple, initial provenance descriptions.
         Three classes provide a basis for the rest of PROV-O:  
       </p>
         <ul>
            <li>An <a class="qname" href="#Entity">prov:Entity</a> is a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary.  
            </li>
            <li>An <a class="qname" href="#Activity">prov:Activity</a> is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.  
            </li>
            <li>An <a class="qname" href="#Agent">prov:Agent</a> is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity. 
            </li>
         </ul> 
      <p>The three primary classes relate to one another and to themselves using the properties shown in the following figure.</p>

      <p>Activities <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> at particular points in time (described using properties 
      <a href='#startedAtTime' class="qname">prov:startedAtTime</a> and <a href='#endedAtTime' class="qname">prov:endedAtTime</a>, respectively) 
      and during their lifespan can  <strong>use</strong> and <strong>generate</strong> a variety of Entities (described with 
      <a href='#used' class="qname">prov:used</a> and <a href='#wasGeneratedBy' class="qname">prov:wasGeneratedBy</a>, respectively). 
      For example, a blog writing activity may use a particular dataset and generate a bar chart. 
      By expressing usage and generation, one can construct provenance chains comprising both Activities and Entities.
      </p>

      <p>In addition, we can say that an Activity <a href='#wasInformedBy' class="qname">prov:wasInformedBy</a>
      another Activity to provide some dependency information without explicitly providing the activities' start and end times. 
      A <span class="repeated">prov:wasInformedBy</span> relation between Activities suggests that the informed Activity used an Entity that was generated by the informing 
      Activity, but the Entity itself is unknown or is not of interest. 
      So, the <span class="repeated">prov:wasInformedBy</span> property allows the construction of provenance chains comprising only Activities.
      </p>

      <p>Provenance chains comprising only Entities can be formed using the <a href='#wasDerivedFrom' class="qname">prov:wasDerivedFrom</a> property.
         A derivation is a transformation of one entity into another. For example, if the Activity that created the bar chart is not known or is not of interest,
          then we can say that the bar chart <span class="repeated">prov:wasDerivedFrom</span> the dataset.
         Arbitrary RDF properties can be used to describe the fixed aspects of an Entity that are interesting within a particular application (for example, 
         the file size and format of the dataset, or the aspect ratio of the bar chart).
      </p>

      <p>While the properties <span class="repeated">prov:used</span>, <span class="repeated">prov:wasGeneratedBy</span>, 
         <span class="repeated">prov:wasInformedBy</span>, and <span class="repeated">prov:wasDerivedFrom</span> can be used to construct provenance chains among 
         Activities and Entities, Agents may also be ascribed responsibility for any Activity or Entity within a provenance chain. 
         An Agent's responsibility for an Activity or Entity is described using the properties <a href='#wasAssociatedWith' class="qname">prov:wasAssociatedWith</a> and 
         <a href='#wasAttributedTo' class="qname">prov:wasAttributedTo</a>, respectively. 
         Agents can also be responsible for other Agents' actions. In this case of delegation, the influencing Agent <a href='#actedOnBehalfOf' class="qname">prov:actedOnBehalfOf</a> 
         another Agent that also bears responsibility for the influenced Activity or Entity.
      </p>

      <p>The properties rdf:type and rdfs:label are used to express <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/prov-dm.html#term-attribute-type">prov:type</a> 
         and <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/default/model/prov-dm.html#term-attribute-label">prov:label</a>, respectively.
      </p>

        <div id="narrative-example-simple-1" about="#narrative-example-simple-1" typeof="prov:Entity" class="exampleOuter" xmlns:prov="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#">
           <p>
            <a href="#narrative-example-simple-1">Example 1</a>: The following PROV-O describes the resources involved when creating a chart about crime statistics. The example uses only Starting Point terms and serves as a basis for elaboration that will be described in subsequent sections. In the example, Derek performs an aggregation of some government crime data, grouping by national regions that are described in a separate dataset by a civil action group.
           </p> 
           <pre rel="prov:wasQuotedFrom" resource="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/tip/ontology/khalid-jun-dropbox/eg16-journalism-simple-without-comments.ttl"
                class="example">{% include "includes/eg16-journalism-simple-without-comments.ttl" %}</pre>
        </div>

      <p>The example states that the agent <code>:derek</code> was associated with two 
      activities: <code>:aggregationActivity</code> and <code>:illustrationActivity</code>. The 
      activity <code>:aggregationActivity</code> used 
      the entities <code>:crimeData</code> (a crime statistics dataset) and <code>:nationalRegionsList</code> (a list of national regions), and 
      generated a new entity, <code>:aggregatedByRegions</code> that aggregates the statistics in
       <code>:crimeData</code> according to the regions in <code>:nationalRegionsList</code>. 
      The <code>:aggregatedByRegions</code> entity was then used by the <code>:illustrationActivity</code> activity, 
      to generate a new entity <code>:bar_chart</code> that depicts the aggregated statistics.
      </p>

      <p> The example also states that the activity <code>:illustrationActivity</code> was 
      informed by the activity <code>:aggregationActivity</code>. Indeed, the former used
       the entity <code>:aggregatedByRegions</code>, which was generated by the latter.
      </p>

      <p> Because the agent <code>:derek</code> was associated with the activities 
      <code>:aggregationActivity</code> and <code>:illustrationActivity</code>, the entities 
      generated by these activities, i.e., <code>:aggregatedByRegions</code> and <code>:bar_chart</code>, were also 
      attributed to him.
      </p>

      <p>Finally, the example states that the agent <code>:derek</code> acted on behalf of the organization <code>:national_newspaper_inc</code>.
