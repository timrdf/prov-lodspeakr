	  	<h3>Starting Point Terms</h3>
       <p>The Starting Point category is a small set of classes and properties that can be used to create simple, initial provenance descriptions.
         Three classes provide a basis for the rest of PROV-O:  
       </p>
         <ul>
            <li>An <a class="qname" href="#Entity">prov:Entity</a> is a physical, digital, conceptual, or other kind of thing with some fixed aspects; entities may be real or imaginary.  
            </li>
            <li>An <a class="qname" href="#Activity">prov:Activity</a> is something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities.  
            </li>
            <li>An <a class="qname" href="#Agent">prov:Agent</a> is something that bears some form of responsibility for an activity taking place, for the existence of an entity, or for another agent's activity. 
            </li>
         </ul> 
      <p>The three primary classes relate to one another and to themselves using the properties shown in the following figure.</p>

      <p>Activities <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> at particular points in time (described using properties 
      <a href='#startedAtTime' class="qname">prov:startedAtTime</a> and <a href='#endedAtTime' class="qname">prov:endedAtTime</a>, respectively) 
      and during their lifespan can  <strong>use</strong> and <strong>generate</strong> a variety of Entities (described with 
      <a href='#used' class="qname">prov:used</a> and <a href='#wasGeneratedBy' class="qname">prov:wasGeneratedBy</a>, respectively). 
      For example, a blog writing activity may use a particular dataset and generate a bar chart. 
      By applying usage and generation, one can construct provenance chains comprising both Activities and Entities.
      </p>

      <p>In addition, we can say that an Activity <a href='#wasInformedBy' class="qname">prov:wasInformedBy</a>
      another Activity to provide some dependency information without explicitly providing the activities' start and end times. 
      A <span class="repeated">prov:wasInformedBy</span> relation between Activities suggests that the informed Activity used an Entity that was generated by the informing 
      Activity, but the Entity itself is not interesting or is unknown. 
      So, the <span class="repeated">prov:wasInformedBy</span> property allows the assertion of provenance chains comprising only Activities.
      </p>

      <p>Provenance chains comprising only Entities can be formed using the <a href='#wasDerivedFrom' class="qname">prov:wasDerivedFrom</a> property.
         A derivation is a transformation of one entity into another. For example, if the Activity that created the bar chart is not interesting or is unknown,
          then we can say that the bar chart <span class="repeated">prov:wasDerivedFrom</span> the dataset.
         Arbitrary RDF properties can be used to describe the fixed aspects of an Entity that are interesting to a particular application (for example, 
         the file size and format of the dataset, or the aspect ratio of the bar chart).
      </p>

      <p>An Agent can be responsible for an Activity or an Entity, which is described using the properties <a href='#wasAssociatedWith' class="qname">prov:wasAssociatedWith</a> and <a href='#wasAttributedTo' class="qname">prov:wasAttributedTo</a>, respectively. Agents can also be responsible for other Agents' actions. In this case, the Agent that influenced an Activity or Entity <a href='#actedOnBehalfOf' class="qname">prov:actedOnBehalfOf</a> another Agent that also bears some responsibility for the resulting Activity or Entity.

           <p>
            <a href="#narrative-example-simple-1">Example 1</a>: The following PROV-O describes the resources involved when creating a chart about crime statistics. The example uses only Starting Point terms and serves as a basis for elaboration that will be described in subsequent sections. In the example, Derek performs an aggregation of some government crime data, grouping by national regions that are described in a separate dataset by a civil action group.
           </p> 
           <pre rel="prov:wasQuotedFrom" resource="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/prov/raw-file/tip/ontology/khalid-jun-dropbox/eg16-journalism-simple-without-comments.ttl"
                class="example">{% include "includes/eg16-journalism-simple-without-comments.ttl" %}</pre>
        </div>

      <p>The example states that the agent <code>ex:derek</code> was associated with two 
      activities: <code>ex:aggregationActivity</code> and <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code>. The 
      activity <code>ex:aggregationActivity</code> used 
      the entities <code>ex:crimeData</code> (a crime statistics dataset) and <code>ex:nationalRegionsList</code> (a list of national regions), and 
      generated a new entity, <code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code>, that aggregates the statistics in
       <code>ex:crimeData</code> according to the regions in <code>ex:nationalRegionsList</code>. 
      The <code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code> entity was then used by the <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code> activity, 
      to generate a new entity <code>ex:chart1</code> that depicts the aggregated statistics.
      </p>

      <p> The example also states that the activity <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code> was 
      informed by the activity <code>ex:aggregationActivity</code>. Indeed, the former used
       the entity <code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code>, which was generated by the latter.
      </p>

      <p> Because the agent <code>ex:derek</code> was associated with the activities 
      <code>ex:aggregationActivity</code> and <code>ex:illustrationActivity</code>, the entities 
      generated by these activities, i.e., <code>ex:aggregatedByRegions</code> and <code>ex:chart1</code>, were 
      attributed to him.
      </p>

      <p>Finally, the example states that the agent <code>ex:derek</code> acted on behalf of the organization <code>ex:national_newspaper_inc</code>.
