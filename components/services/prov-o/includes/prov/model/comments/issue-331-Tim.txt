We made a selection of constructs to appear in section 2 (and used in 3). 
We only represent those here.  

Adding more concepts to section 2 would make it even longer. We have
some comments that it may be too long already.

Whole paragraph rewritten as follows:

Figure 1 is not intended to be complete: it only illustrates types and relations introduced in this section (Section 2), exploited in the example discussed in Section 3, and explained in detail in Section 4. Names of relations depicted in Figure 1 are listed in the third column of Table 2. These names are part of a textual notation to write instances of the PROV-DM data model, which we introduce in the next section.

Primary binary relation is between activity and agent, and explicitly represented.
Plan is a further attribute of wasAssociatedWith.

We may want to say that we want responsibility to stay out of the derivation component.
This would be a good refactoring I believe: we would remove agents from quotation and revision.
We would keep derivation/responsibility well distinct.

But we shouldn't conflate responsibility and accounts.

Revision is a particular case of derivation of an entity into its revised version.

--> Insertion provides an "update semantics" for the keys that are already present in a collection, since a new pair replaces an existing pair with the same key in the new collection. This is illustrated by the following example.

I think it should. It's the rendering application that creates the note. Text changed as follows:


The note is linked to the entity tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215, with relation hasAnnotation discussed in Section 4.6.2. The note's identifier and attributes are declared in the namespace denoted by prefix ex to illustrate that the rendering application may differ from the application involving entity tr:WD-prov-dm-20111215.

It is not forgotten. It's ISSUE-260.

Simply I had no time to work on it. 
To address your point, we need an agreed notion of account.

It is unclear to me whether this is equivalent to a derivation of provenance.
